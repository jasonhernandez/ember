//! Lightweight state reconciliation for crash recovery.
//!
//! Called on every command invocation to clean up after crashes:
//!
//! 1. For each VM in Running/Paused state, check if the Firecracker PID
//!    is still alive. If dead, mark the VM as Stopped and clean up its
//!    network resources (TAP device, iptables rules, IP allocation).
//!
//! 2. Find orphaned TAP devices belonging to *this* installation
//!    (matched against [`network::tap::prefix`] for the install's
//!    namespace) and delete them. Other ember installs use distinct
//!    prefixes, so reconciliation here never touches their devices.
//!
//! All operations are best-effort: errors are logged but never propagated,
//! since reconciliation should not block normal CLI operation.
