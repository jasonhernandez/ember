//! Backend trait definitions for VM, storage, and networking.
//!
//! Each trait is implemented by a platform-specific type:
//!   - **Linux**: Firecracker (KVM) + ZFS zvols + TAP/iptables
//!   - **macOS**: Apple Virtualization Framework (via `ember-vz`) + APFS clones + vmnet
//!
//! The active implementation is selected at compile time in the binary crate
//! and re-exported as type aliases (`Vm`, `Storage`, `Network`).
